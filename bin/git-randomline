"""
Randomly choose a file and a line in it from the repo files.

Inspired by http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Accts/TS/Wb2/WalkThru.html
Basic idea:

1. Let this script give you some point in the repo.
2. Explain the line in 5 minutes

Could be great for impromptu presentations to
* get team members familiar with project code
* lightning talks in a conference
* test knowledge breadth of a programmer

Possible use:
$ vi $(git randomline)
